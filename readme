Run step4_analysis.py to get results (plots of accelerations and angles vs. time) for individual lengths. 
To change the length to be plotted, change the assignment of the variable “filename” to one of the following 
data files for different pendulum lengths:
length 18.csv
length 24.5.csv
length 31.5.csv
length 39.csv
length 48.5.csv
